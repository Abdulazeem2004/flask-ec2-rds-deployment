# flask-ec2-rds-deployment
This project is an end-to-end cloud-hosted full-stack application deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using real production-level architecture. It demonstrates how to run a Flask backend API, serve a static frontend, and store user-submitted data in a managed cloud database — all hosted securely and efficiently on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.
